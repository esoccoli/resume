# My resume using AltaCV

This is my current resume, made in LaTeX using the AltaCV template, which I found on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/altacv-template/trgqjpwnmtgv)
It was last updated on January 2nd, 2023.

To view the actual resume, go to `/out/sample.pdf`. This file is viewable here within Github. You can also view the file by downloading it, or by cloning the repository and running it on a local machine, and then opening `sample.pdf` in the browser of your choice.


For more information about the AltaCV class/template, see the file AltaCV.md, in the `info` folder
