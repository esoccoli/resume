# My resume using AltaCV

This is my current resume, made in LaTeX using the AltaCV template, which I found on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/altacv-template/trgqjpwnmtgv)
It was last updated on January 2nd, 2023.

To view the actual resume clone this repository and run it your local machine. Running the program for the first time should cause a few new files to be created. Find the file named `sample.pdf` and open it in the browser of your choice. Each time the resume is updated, your will need to pull the changes and run the program again to update the local output file.
